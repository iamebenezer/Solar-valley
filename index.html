                            concepts follow the deconstruction and reconstruction 
                            of the Bitcoin system. Namecoin and Peercoin made 
                            landmark contributions in the process of moving from 
                            cryptocurrencies to the blockchain concept, while 
                            Bitshares and Ethereum furthered our understanding of 
                            the blockchain.</p></li>

                            Unlike Peercoin and Bitshares, Ethereum uses the PoW
                            consensus protocol to secure its network in its early 
                            stages and will transition to a PoS consensus protocol 
                            by forking. This design primarily considers the system’s 
                            safety during its initial stages. In addition, Ethereum 
                            implemented the concept of smart contracts, its most 
                            important contribution apart from its enhancement of 
                            block creation characteristics and reward mechanisms. 
                            Through smart contracts and its specially-developed 
                            EVM, Ethereum expanded the range of transaction 
                            types that could be handled by blockchains, with the 
                            downside that all transaction types on Ethereum must 
                            be implemented in the form of contracts.

                A place older than time itself, A Universe that was meant for peace & serenity. There previous galaxy in the 7th dimension 
was built and sustained for each being's desires and true form. Solar being one of the original Gods gathered 9 higher 
powerful beings and fled from the terrors that were unleashed and ripping through there divine galaxy they once called 
home! Once reaching the 6th dimension they knew they had only a short time to grow and prepare for the ultimate battle 
inside the SolarVerse!

                The universe was dark when the Beings arrived. They originated in the 7th Dimension, where all possible 
universes were visible and accessible to them. Their race existed as enigmatic beings completely unique from one of 
another and numbed in the thousands. But, as all civilizations are wont to do, tempers flared, and opinions differed. As 
their civilization began to descend into civil war, 10 of the Beings descended to the 3rd Dimension—a place rarely visited 
by their kind due to its simplistic nature. The Beings chose a dark and empty universe, one that had not yet been touched 
by light or life. Their arrival heralded these catalysts, giving life to the stagnant universe. The Beings were tempted as 
plants began to form. No longer held back by the restraints they had to follow in the 7th Dimension, the Beings each 
claimed their own planet and shaped it in their image. As species began to walk the planets the Beings created, they 
realized a horrible fault— even though their arrival had heralded life, there was nothing in this universe that could support 
and sustain life. The 10th Being, Solar, pledged to keep life in the universe from extinguishing. She sacrificed herself, fusing
with her planet to create a sun that would provide the necessary criteria for the other Beings’ planets to continue to 
thrive. Her planet became the Solar Forge, a world heralded and greatly worshiped by all life in the universe.
